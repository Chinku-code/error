Dear Akshata,

    My office access card has not been working properly for the last few days. The access team has checked it and advised me to raise a support ticket from my Bank ID is V1021008 so that a new access card can be issued.

I request you to please help with issuing a new access card at the earliest. Please let me know if any additional details or formalities are required from my side.


Thanks & Regards
